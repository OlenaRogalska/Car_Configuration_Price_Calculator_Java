Short work description

1. The line with type of vehicle name is added to text file. Type of vehicle are  car and golf cart.
2. Array converted to ArryList for Options and OptionSet class attributes
3. Automobile class converted to abstract class with Car and GolfCart subclasses
4. New class Fleet holds all Automobile's objects from all read files as LinkedHashMap with vehicle as value and its model name as key
5. Fleet class converted into generic LinkedHashMap class holds <String, T>, where T may by any type of vehicle


6. The simple sequence of steps for the program is next: 
1) read text file (method called from Driver)
2) define the type of vehicle and create Automobile object as type Car or GolfCart
3) store all information from text file into Automobile subclass object
4) add this vehicle to Fleet LinkedHashMap and display notice if object hasn't been added
4) do the same steps 2 and 3 for the next one text file (method called from Driver)
5) for each Automobile subclass object find the model name, add pair (model name and filled Automobile subclass objects) to Fleet LinkedHashMap
6) for chosen model (predefine in Driver) look for Automobile subclass object from Fleet LinkedHashMap
5) display set of option and ask user for choice (Scanner used)
6) chosen option stored in  ArryList choice in Automobile subclass
7) search for price of this option in Automobile subclass object's options and add this number (price) to total (first time it's a basic) price. update
8) repeat steps 5, 6 and 7 for each option set
9) display total price
10) check the length of LinkedHashMap
11) traverse through LinkedHashMap and by given name (method called from Driver) to find chosen model. Display all model's features
